Django HTTP method-specific class-based views
---------------------------------------------

The goal of this lib is to be a repository of base class-based views to ease
the process of creating new CBVs while following the best pratices we adopt. It
also helps to keep security concerns in a single place so we can address them
with a single version upgrade.
